    <h2>About The Ministry</h2>
    <h3>Vision</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center;">
        "Look unto me and be ye saved, all the ends the earth for I am God and there is none else” (Isaiah 45:22).
    </p>

    <p>
        The Bible passage above came from the dramatic encounter of an individual trapped in inferno, crying for help and could not be rescued due to the scare of the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
        In the real life sensibility this calls for a challenge to evangelistic ministry and the resultant task to win souls who are on the path of sin and evil before the final destination of all sinners in hell fire. This is why the New Glory Faith ministry is branded ‘The Outreach Church’ to win souls from the world as the lord commanded us in the Great Commission (Matthew 28:19-20, Mark 16:15-18).
    </p>
    <h3>Mission</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Personal Evangelism- A person to person witnessing to lead a sinner to repentance and ultimate conversion. (2 Corinthians 5:17)
            </li>

            <li>
                Mass Evangelism - in crusades (local and city wide) radio, Tvs,tracts distribution. etc
            </li>

            <li>
                Social Media evangelism -    The church arm of the ministry is to absorb and nurture the converts from the Outreach arm  and prepare them for further Evangelism tasks to reproduce themselves in others. 
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>The church is saddled with the responsibility of not only sustaining a work force base where converts become soul winners, but also of preparing all, for heaven in “True holiness”.</p>
    </p>
    <h3>The visioner</h3>
    <div id="rev">
        <img src="rev.jpeg" alt="">
    </div>
    <p>It is not out of place to bring up the set-man for this Commission for there is no Vision without a Visioner in the person of Rev Abraham Kayode Abraham. </p>
    <p>This God’s servant was called to the ministry while in school in the encounter described above. He was so much in the grip of the burning soul scenario that he was weeping in the dream and wept out into daylight still crying!A verse of the scripture was given him which is what is quoted in the opening passage.</p>
    <p>This simply is his call into the evangelistic ministry (Isaiah 45:22).</p>
    <p>“He was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision”(Acts 26:19).</p>
    <p>Meanwhile he served as a corper at the Deeper Christian Life Ministry Headquarters in Lagos. The leader talked him to continuing with them as their Evangelist, having perceived the grace of God in him. Since the service year he started an Evangelistic group called the “Mobile Harvesters” and holding crusades in large places with signs following.</p>
    <P>He was later appointed the state overseer to start the ministry in Adamawa and Taraba states. After raising thousands from the scratch he was posted to Oyo and Osun states as the state overseer. In his ministry the Holy Ghost worked diverse wonders in salvation of souls, healings to the blind, lame, deaf and dumb, hump back, leprosy, total paralysis and the dead raised to life. The man of God has the calling and gifting of an Evangelist and the Ministry of a Pastor. To God be the Glory.</P>

        <h2 >Testimonies</h2>
        <p >By the grace of God the healing stream of God is not stagnant in our church it is moving with full force. Apart from the past footprints of God in our midst, In the recent times:</p>
        <div id="testimonies">
            <ol>
                <li>A medical doctor was healed of cancer through our prayers</li>
                <li>A child born dumb was healed in our midst.</li>
                <li>A sister was healed of Fibroid growth without an operation again.</li>
                <li>A student was healed of liver complication.</li>
                <li>A brother was healed from an undisclosed life threatening sickness and brought back to life.</li>
                <li>A heart operation was canceled through our distant prayer from Lagos to USA and the patient was wheeled out of the theatre after God healed him and lots more.</li>
